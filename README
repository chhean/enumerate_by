== Description

Support for enumerations is dependent on the type of database you use.  For
example, MySQL has native support for the enum data type.  However, there is
no native Rails support for defining enumerations and the associations between
it and other models in the application.

acts_as_enumeration adds support for enumerations in Rails by providing methods
for interacting with records in a table as if they were values in an
enumeration.

See the API for usage examples.

== Testing

This plugin requires that the plugin_test_helper gem be installed in order to
run the unit tests.  To install this gem:

  gem install plugin_test_helper
